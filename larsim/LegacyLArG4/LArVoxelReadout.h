/// \brief A Geant4 sensitive detector that accumulates voxel information.
///
/// \author  seligman@nevis.columbia.edu
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
/// One way to implement voxels in Geant4 is to create a parallel
/// "read-out" geometry along with the real, physical geometry.  The
/// read-out geometry is implemented in LArVoxelReadoutGeometry; this
/// class is the sensitive detector for that geometry.  That is,
/// Geant4 will call this routine every time there is a step within a
/// volume of the read-out geometry; this routine then accumulates
/// information from that step.
///
/// In general, Geant4 expects to have per-event user information
/// attached to the G4Event in some way; their G4VSensitiveDetector
/// class supports this by allowing user-defined hit collections to
/// added to a G4HCOfThisEvent object (a collection of hit
/// collections; yes, it makes my head ache too!) that's part of each
/// G4Event.
///
/// This class works differently, by accumulating the information in
/// its internal sim::LArVoxelList.  See LArVoxelListAction for how
/// this information is made available to the main LArG4 module.
///
/// Why define a parallel geometry?  Here are some reasons:
///
/// - The regular LAr TPC is one large volume of liquid argon.  When
///   Geant4 does its physics modeling, it can be unconstrained in
///   step size by the voxels.  Only for readout would the steps be
///   sub-divided.
///
/// - There may be more than one kind of readout, depending on a
///   detector's instrumentation (e.g., OpDets in addition to the wire
///   planes).  It's possible that the voxelization appropriate for
///   the wire planes may not be an appropriate readout for the other
///   readouts.  Geant4 allows the construction of multiple parallel
///   readouts, so this mechanism is relatively easy to extend for
///   each type of readout.

   * @brief Transports energy depositions from GEANT4 to TPC channels.
   *
   * This class acts on single energy depositions from GEANT4, simulating the
   * transportation of the ensuing ionisation electrons to the readout channels:
   *
   * 1. the number of ionisation electrons is read from the current
   *   `larg4::IonizationAndScintillation` instance
   * 2. space charge displacement is optionally applied
   * 3. lifetime correction is applied
   * 4. charge is split in small electron clusters
   * 5. each cluster is subject to longitudinal and transverse diffusion
   * 6. each cluster is assigned to one TPC channel for each wire plane
   * 7. optionally, charge is forced to stay on the planes; otherwise charge
   *    drifting outside the plane is lost
   *
   * For each energy deposition, entries on the appropriate `sim::SimChannel`
   * are added, with the information of the position where the energy deposit
   * happened (in global coordinates, centimeters), the ID of the Geant4
   * track which produced the deposition, and the quantized time of arrival to
   * the channel (in global TDC tick units).
   * At most one entry is added for each electron cluster, but entries from the
   * same energy deposit can be compacted if falling on the same TDC tick.
   *
   * The main entry point of this class is the method `ProcessHits()`.
   *
   * Options
   * --------
   *
   * A few optional behaviours are supported:
   *
   * * lead off-plane charge to the planes: regulated by
   *   `RecoverOffPlaneDeposit()`, if charge which reaches a wire plane
   *   is actually off it by less than the chosen margin, it's accounted for by
   *   that plane; by default the margin is 0 and all the charge off the plane
   *   is lost (with a warning)
   *

     * @param plane the plane to test the position against
     * @return a position on plane, unless pos is too far from it
     *
     * This method considers the distance of the position `pos` from the active
     * part of the `plane` (see `geo::Plane::DeltaFromActivePlane()`).
     * If the position is less than a configurable margin far from the plane,
     * the closest point on the plane to that position is returned. Otherwise,
     * the position itself is returned.
     *
     * Ionization charge may be drifted so that when it arrives to the plane, it
     * actually does not hit the area covered by wires. This can happen for many
     * reasons:
     * * space charge distortion led the point outside the fiducial volume
     *   (this may be prevented by specific code)
     * * diffusion pushes the charge outside the instrumented region
     * * the geometry of the wire planes is such that planes have different
     *   coverage and what one plane can cover, the next can't
     *
     * The "recovery" consists in forcing the charge to the instrumented area
     * covered by the plane wires.
     * The distance of the drifted charge from each plane border is computed and
     * compared to the margin. If that distance is smaller than the margin, it
     * is neglected and the charge is assigned a new position on that border.
     *
     * This method provides the position that should be used for the charge
     * deposition.
     *
     * This is a simplistic approach to the simulation of border effects,
     * assuming that in fact the electric field, which is continuous and
     * pointing to the collection wires, will drive the charge to the wires even
     * when they are "off track".
     * No correction is applied for the additional time that such deviation
     * would take.
